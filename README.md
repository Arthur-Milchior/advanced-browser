Use multiple columns in the note editor. The editor is present in multiple parts of Anki and all instances of it will be affected. [Here is a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/WhEuig7.png) for an example. You can easily change the number of columns shown using the *Columns* field added by the add-on.


##Strip Arabic Diacritics###

![Arabic diacritics](https://raw.github.com/hssm/anki-addons/master/docs/ar_diacritics.png "Strip Arabic diacritics in card browser")

Ignore "optional" diacritical marks in Arabic text when searching in the card browser and match only against the base characters. This allows you to enter words without any vocalizations but still find them in your deck if they do use them. Since Arabic learning materials typically do use vocalizations (which can become quite convoluted), this feature can be very convenient for a student of Arabic using Anki.
