This is a repository for my small Anki add-ons. Larger add-ons will get their own repos.

All code in this repository is GPLv3.

Add-on list:
- [Strip Arabic Diacritics](#strip-arabic-diacritics)
- [Internal Fields in Browser](#internal-fields-in-browser)

![Arabic diacritics](https://raw.github.com/hssm/anki-addons/master/docs/ar_diacritics.png "Strip Arabic diacritics in card browser")

Ignore "optional" diacritical marks in Arabic text when searching in the card browser and match only against the base characters. This allows you to enter words without any vocalizations but still find them in your deck if they do use them. Since Arabic learning materials typically do use vocalizations (which can become quite convoluted), this feature can be very convenient for a student of Arabic using Anki.

![IFIB](https://raw.github.com/hssm/anki-addons/master/docs/ifib.png "Internal fields in card browser")

Adds the ability to show and sort by some of the internal fields for notes and cards within the card browser. 

Useful fields include:
- First review date
- Latest review date
- Average answer time
- Total answer time
- Tags

The majority of the other fields will serve no use for just about everybody, except for maybe add-on authors.
