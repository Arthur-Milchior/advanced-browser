This is a repository for my small Anki add-ons. Larger add-ons will get their own repos.

All code in this repository is licensed under GPLv3.

Add-on list:
- [Media Import](#media-import)
- [Multi-Column Note Editor](#multi-column-note-editor)
- [Strip Arabic/Hebrew Diacritics](#strip-arabic-diacritics)

Work-in-progress.

Use multiple columns in the note editor. You can easily change the number of columns shown using the *Columns* field added by the add-on, and you can have a different number of columns for different note types and window types (browser, note adder, etc).

If you have any fields that take up a lot of space, you can configure them to take up an entire row.

##Strip Arabic and Hebrew Diacritics###

![Arabic/Hebrew diacritics](https://raw.github.com/hssm/anki-addons/master/docs/ar_diacritics.png "Strip Arabic/Hebrew diacritics in card browser")

Ignore "optional" diacritical marks in Arabic or Hebrew text when searching in the card browser and match only against the base characters. This allows you to enter words without any vocalizations but still find them in your deck if they do use them. Since learning materials typically do use vocalizations (which can become quite convoluted), this feature can be very convenient for a student of Arabic or Hebrew using Anki.
