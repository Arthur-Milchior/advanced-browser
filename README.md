Use multiple columns in the note editor. You can easily change the number of columns shown using the *Columns* field added by the add-on, and you can have a different number of columns for different note types and window types (browser, note adder, etc).

If you have any fields that take up a lot of space, you can configure them to take up an entire row.

![Ignore accents](https://raw.github.com/hssm/anki-addons/master/docs/ar_diacritics.png "Ignore diacritics in browser search")

Ignore accents and diacritical marks used by various languages when searching in the card browser and match only against the base characters. This allows you to enter only the base characters in the browser search bar even if your notes have the words written with the marks included.
